Write a Python program to check if a given input number is a Meraki number. A number is called Meraki number if all adjacent digits in it differ by 1. All <strong>single digits </strong>are <strong>always </strong>considered as Meraki number. Some examples of Meraki number are 0, 5, 10, 12, 78, 567, 101, 6787, 21012. E.g., 21012,

(2-1=1), (1-0=1), (0-1=1 (mod value)), (1-2=1(mod value))

Your program must contain a user/programmer-defined function meraki helper (n) that prints “yes” or “no” if the input number is Meraki or not along the number (e.g, . Yes – 12 is a Meraki number, OR No, 72 is Not a meraki number). Finally your program should print the count of meraki numbers and non meraki numbers. E.g., the input list contains 12 meraki and 9 non meraki numbers.
